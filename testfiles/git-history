commit 5216e2e88939120ffa33fd58a0020cd6162f598e
Date:   Thu Jan 18 18:42:14 2018 +0000

    Testing File progress. Extra sixel testing file to dial in the few codes that had been miswritten. Considering going back and using binary comparison and shift model to calculate, instead. Only if there is time.

Date:   Thu Jan 18 00:14:23 2018 +0000

    Bed time fixing redundant and repeating functions. Changed three separate draw char functions into 2. Working on reducing cases and switches. 

commit 95e29cd4e48d6c166e320e8723a36a3b1872060c
Date:   Wed Jan 17 17:56:55 2018 +0000

    Platform for seperate testing file being setup. Looking at old testbst model for examples. I dont like how assert forces a crash, so I need to make an alternative that keeps program running unless there is a SERIOUS issue -- keeps track.

Date:   Mon Jan 8 15:38:11 2018 +0000

    Working test.m7 file. Working sep, font, hold, etc. Where is your God now? 50% done. Break for architecture viva study.

    going to MVB. Working on hold function.

commit 2adf1db6c3281dfd4fafe14e0bc08bc4890730aa
Date:   Mon Jan 8 13:32:47 2018 +0000

    Attempting holding graphics. Maybe issue with sixels. Separated working.

commit 65c38d767096e9210027491126a77338df7002bc
Date:   Mon Jan 8 13:11:18 2018 +0000

    improved sixels. killed the rainbow. Think it has something to do with hold setting. Sixel backgrounds were coming out wrong color so I made sure to set deactivated small sixels to the background color, instead of not rendering them at all. Should have fixed. Some sixels are off though as translation isn't perfect. Need to make some sort of file to compare. 

commit 440a6e531f69a088c667a36ab448fe8af6251a64
Date:   Sun Jan 7 23:23:26 2018 +0000

    Working sixel plan. hacky inefficient. God, Why have you abandoned me? Seriously thinking of just casing them all out in a list of 40. I know there is a clever way to do this involving math, but id rather just get them working so I can move on. NOTE COME BACK. 

commit da18c7ed968522de664a68508d4b0755bd67651d
Date:   Sun Jan 7 21:06:53 2018 +0000

    Sixel break for bed. Difference between contig and separated is simple, just put if condition on graphics mode and reduce small sixel triangle size by one if separated hits.

Date:   Sun Jan 7 20:21:35 2018 +0000

    Preparing for contig, separated and graphics. Sixels brainstorming.

commit 0f9d5391e901b7ec51e1d1ec4df1587d3618ea54
Date:   Sun Jan 7 18:59:34 2018 +0000

    Working background colors and no artifacting. Do you think this is a game? Artifacting was solved by adding a function that converts any codes that are outside the range of the hexsheet to either a blank space - a0, or a code inside the range. 

commit 6d2068c7f20590ee176bd4aaf253d3af322b8a2d
Date:   Sun Jan 7 18:32:58 2018 +0000

    Working background colors but still weird artifacting where there are control codes

commit 2e54b5c5d16d333e81cea5f35b8c87b61b24c3a0
Date:   Sun Jan 7 15:45:17 2018 +0000

    Double Height working, but there is pixel error on bottom half of lines. Looks like a sweet retro 80s effect which is good. Maybe a feature not a bug. 

commit 0caa50a7bbc2cb6b798d1125ad43e9dbcb487016
Date:   Sun Jan 7 14:04:41 2018 +0000

    Working double height. Top and bottom. Moving onto resolution and sizing. Got bottom by checking the size flag of the row above the current row. If it was a topfont row, it would set the current one to bottom. Rendering bottom half of text was tougher. Making double size involved bottom 7 coord, but getting bottom half involved changing ycoordinate of 2d array that prints actual char. Took forever. 

commit 1fd293727a11a5658eb5aace802922d9b52c36e2
Date:   Sun Jan 7 13:25:52 2018 +0000

    Functioning uppercase double, working on implementing bottom bits. Front was done by just putting a qualifying if statement for the topfont flag set in my code case/switch statements that links to a copy of sdl draw char. Then I just changed the value of the y coordinate at the bottom, and timesed it by two. Im messing around with other vales. Not sure how to get bottom, as the same value doesnt effect it at all. Lots of trial and error. Need to start thinking about a testing platform. 

commit 95f0bf4579229d6dad701ad89e5589ab0a337e40
Date:   Sat Jan 6 17:01:01 2018 +0000

    Going home. Working colors. Ideas about double height. Background was easy, and just requires setting the background color in the flag struct to the foreground color in the same struct. SDL Draw Char already has a default to background color, and I just changed that to the current backcolor. 

commit 6b6dfbdc8dc74467ce9f4f27e29cd7ebbd0f5a83
Date:   Sat Jan 6 16:04:31 2018 +0000

    Working colors for foreground. Needs to be struct that contains current global into that then passes that info to all proceeding cells on a line. Color working good, but still have artifacting before words, and purple is way off. Seems like pink. Starting background colors.

commit f8b76ce3b0ebbae220eb3d120332338eb85826e0
Date:   Sat Jan 6 15:04:57 2018 +0000

    Scared to make big change backup. Going to separate into different .c files based on tasks. Starting a potential test.c. Have spent the morning working on color. Colors need to be set globally, and remain set -- currently only setting color for tile that has the code. 

commit 203828a38bcb2f93941bd5add177abc825c9fae6
Date:   Fri Jan 5 19:29:37 2018 +0000

    Structures organized, working on parsing color. Structure now contains an element for each flag that needs to be activated. Color needs to be set through SDL with combination of 255 x 3

commit 8282e7961b6b16a7cb917e1bb337537323f5c477
Date:   Fri Jan 5 16:39:56 2018 +0000

    Friday night: Managed to put codes into 2d array of structs. Have to declare 2d array as same type as the structs that it contains. Reading codes in was not possible, except using fread for me. Not sure about other ways to approach but it seems to be working. Printing still works.

Date:   Fri Jan 5 14:53:47 2018 +0000

    Worked on everything and accomplished nothing at school and have lost faith in God.

Date:   Fri Jan 5 12:25:20 2018 +0000

    Friday morning update.

commit c5d3ff983e79c65f227ebcaf3efe391ea2c5162d
Date:   Thu Jan 4 17:38:28 2018 +0000

    Conversion to ASCII now in PrintCodes() function. Display works for symbols, letters and numbers now. Formatting actually looks okay.Figured out in lab that you just need to subtract 128 from integer value of codes to convert to ascii. I feel dumb.

Date:   Wed Jan 3 15:45:01 2018 +0000

    printed hex codes in sdl with new function printCodes() Managed to print a 2D array on SDL that contains the hexcodes. Worked on sizing the screen to fit the propper number of cells, but got this wrong. Started brainstorming about how to change codes from hex into ascii. 

commit b9841bd3a68cdbb54f3ecc03bed78b02a1e084bf
Date:   Wed Jan 3 13:47:27 2018 +0000

    Working SDL window with strings and font loading.

	Got it by pillaging the blocks.c file from our assignment on conways soldiers. Copy/pasted neilsdl2h functions into my code, and used them. Used his drawstring function to write random words to screen. Used his load font function to bring in the provided font. 

commit 37d4d5f8467a584476812aeb85b067205a9a3be9
Date:   Tue Jan 2 12:58:55 2018 +0000

    First version of 2d array hex code

	Got the codes imported from the test.m7 file and printed them out to terminal. started interpreting their meaning given the pdf chart. Started planning.

TESTING: 










Can be initiated by terminal: "./test filename.m7"

TESTING FILES:
-------------
TEST.M7 - standard generalized test code provided. Tests everything briefly. 
SIXELCHART.M7 - chart of all possible sixels for comparison with assignment. 
PANDA.M7 - pixel panda. Testing sixels, and graphics settings. 
LFC.M7 - testing the patience of ManU fans everywhere. 




Testing is broken up into several parts. 









BASIC FILE MANAGEMENT
---------------------
I have created a series of testing functions in testing.c that check: ARGC (inc irregular cases), FILEOPEN, FILEREAD, etc...











SIXELS
------
Sixels cans be tested with the hex file: "testfiles/sixelchart.m7"

SIXELS (IN DETAIL)
------------------
Inside the program the loading of graphics modes (seperate and contiguous) is tested several ways in testing.c. The SetFlag function is tested, as is its holding abilities. Each color is tested, changed, and then restested.
